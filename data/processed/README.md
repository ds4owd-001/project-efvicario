## Methodological information

1.  Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

One hundred and sixteen (116) households were identified using geographically stratified random sampling; Korle Gonno was split into four quadrants and Abuja was bisected using major roads for demarcation. Sixty households were identified using a spatial mapping software by number assignment and random number selection. For households without any suitable respondents available, the nearest household to the right was selected. Suitable respondents were adult household members (at least 18 years of age) who claimed to be knowledgeable about household water collection practices and agreed to be surveyed. 

Surveys were read orally by Author A or B (depending on respondent's preferred language), and enumerated by Author A on a tablet. A free data management platform called mWater (https://www.mwater.co/) was used for survey creation, deployment, and data export.

"Household" in this survey was defined as a group of people who live in the same housing unit and usually have meals together, or "eat from the same pot." Information about primary drinking water sources and reasoning was collected but is not analyzed here.

2.  Methods for processing the data:

Data processing involved:

    1) adding columns to the data to calculate total household population and household density
    2) setting NA values to be omitted during analysis
    3) setting value types to numeric for certain categories that were read as character-type: daily household water cost and daily household water cost per household member
    4) pivoting to long-format data for side-by-side comparisons of multiple categories (community & coping mechanisms)
    5) setting orders for ordinal variables used in data visualization (e.g., time of last struggle to find water: in the last three days, in the last week, in the last month...)

3.  Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the
    data: 
None

4.  Standards and calibration information, if appropriate: 
N/A

5.  Environmental/experimental conditions: 
November is the dry season. Respondents noted that water provision is inconsistent in the dry season and before the holidays, as the utility preps for greater loading in December (tourism season).

6.  Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data: 
None
