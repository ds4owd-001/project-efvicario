# My project

## Analysis goals

With this data, I would like to compare water storage capacity, shortage coping mechanisms, and struggles with water (using multiple metrics) between communities. I would like to see if a relationship exists between water storage capacity and water struggles.

## Load packages and data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
read_excel("data/raw/owd_ghana_water_household_survey.xlsx")
```
