This paper contributes to the overall understanding of sociospatial conditions of urban water (in)security in GAMA. By looking at the geography of infrastructure and inequalities in water access, it seeks to identify patterns of uneven access to water. The first part provides an overview of urban water supply in GAMA, focusing on water infrastructure and the perspective of water providers. In the second part, households’ access strategies are discussed by combining both quantitative and qualitative perspectives.

	abstract = {In this paper, we analyse the heterogeneity of water supply infrastructure in Accra, Ghana, to understand the politics of water in cities where infrastructural diversity has always been the norm. We do this by extending the use of heterogeneous infrastructure configurations as a heuristic device, shifting the focus and scale of urban political ecological analyses of infrastructural diversity from users and access to water distributions at city scale. To explain the impacts of three experiments in the distribution of water across the city, we analyse how changes in the technical and operational arrangements of Accra?s bulk water filling points reflect changes in the social relations of cooperation or conflict between the diversity of actors and infrastructure supplying water across the city. We find the uneven waterscape of the city is shaped by a plurality of actors whose practices are informed by a range of motives. These motives exceed profit-making, political legitimacy, patronage and petty corruption including also solidarity, religious beliefs and pragmatic choices. We show that distributions of water, risks and responsibilities among different actors involved in operating the water filling points are constantly contested with ambiguous and unforeseen outcomes foreclosing but also opening new possibilities for progressive experimentation. Documenting how relations between actors and technologies of water provisioning are dynamic, and open to incremental improvements towards progressive (re)distributions of water, our analysis at the city scale calls for further focus on how practices and policies of solidarity can be extended across heterogeneous provisioning systems.},

The findings reveal that vendors fall into three main work categories: ‘seekers’ (who actively chose the ‘female’ occupation), ‘finders’ (who did not actively seek the occupation but who found it in the process of a job search) and ‘settlers’ (who actively chose the occupation, due to rising unemployment, and then settled in the job). In terms of job orientation, settlers are associated with intrinsic rewards than finders who seek extrinsic rewards. The findings further indicate that men sell 10 bags daily less than what women sell 15 bags—an indication of vendors contribution to the booming sachet water business in Accra. Averagely, while men earn GH¢25 daily, women earn GH¢35 which is almost 6 times higher than the daily-minimum-wage (DMW) pegged at GH¢6.},

	abstract = {This article contributes to shaping the discourse on unequal geographies of infrastructure and governance in the global South, opening up new ways of thinking through politics, practices and modalities of power. Conceptually, informality, governance and everyday urbanism are drawn on to unpack how the formal encounters the informal in ways that (re)configure infrastructure geographies and governance practices. This conceptual framing is empirically employed through an analysis of electricity access in Accra, Ghana, highlighting how residents navigate unequal electricity topographies, engage in self-help initiatives, and negotiate informal networks and formal governance practices. The spatiality of the electricity infrastructure has created inequity and opportunities for exploitation by ?power-owners? and ?power-agents? who control and manage the electricity distribution network and, in turn, privately supply power. Electricity connections are negotiated, access is monetised and illegality excused on grounds of good-neighbourliness, thereby producing and perpetuating everyday politics of ?making do?. Community movements, everyday acts of improvisation, and incremental modifications are shown to influence the workings of formal institutions of government and shape uneven power relations and experiences of inequality. Such an understanding of how marginalised residents navigate the electricity topographies of Accra reveals a more nuanced politics of infrastructure access, which reflects the complex realities of hybridised modalities of governance and the multiple everyday dimensions of power that shape urban space. The article concludes that informality should not be recognised as failure but as a sphere of opportunity, innovation and transition.},

Four climate change scenarios were considered in addition to a reference (no change) scenario—two dry and two wet scenarios. To conduct the analysis, a portion of a special framework using three water models was used; the framework is called the Strategic Analysis of Climate resilient Development (SACReD). First, the CliRun water balance model was used to simulate catchment runoffs using projected rainfall and temperature under the scenarios. Second, climate impacts on yields of the economically important Ghana crops were modeled using the AquaCrop software. Third, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) software was used for the water allocation modeling. The results show that all water demands (municipal, hydropower, and agriculture) cannot be simultaneously met currently, or under any of the scenarios used, including the wet scenarios. This calls for an evaluation of groundwater as an additional source of water supply and an integrated water resources management plan in the catchments to balance demand with supply and ensure sustainable socio-economic development. In addition, the AquaCrop model forecasts negative impacts for the crop yields studied, with some crops and regions seeing larger impacts than others.},

	abstract = {Plastic packaged water is the drinking water of choice for urban populations across Africa but its quality remains questionable in most developing countries. Six hundred (600) packages, consisting of sachet and bottled water, were sampled from two high-end companies in Accra (Ghana) and stored through their shelf lives under an average room temperature of 30 °C. The samples were tested for physicochemical quality and the presence of bacteria and phthalate esters at 2n × 3 periods, where n is the sampled batch number. The data were described and modelled with embedded Bayesian and Machine Learning algorithms in JASP0.16.0.0 and Argo-4.1.3. The results reported lower than regulated levels of electrical conductivity (163.66 μS/cm), alkalinity (39.67 mg/L), and residual chlorine ({\textless}0.01 mg/L) while the pH was generally within specification (6.5–7.7). All samples showed progressive biological contamination following the third week (sachet samples) and the sixth week (bottled water) of incubation. Initial samples, including raw water, processed bulk water and packaged water did not present detectable microbial growth. The total microbial load in sachet samples grew at 0.936 cfu/week and 1.006 cfu/week for the bottled samples although the results did not exceed 1000 cfu/L (0-976 cfu/100 mL). Modelled mean probability of infection was 1.196 × 10−4 in 67\% of the samples. Raw and processed water samples did not show detectable levels of phthalate contaminants. The mean hazard index calculated on the individual hazard quotients of phthalates was 7.41 × 10−3 ± 8.20 × 10−4, suggesting lower acute risk potential. Mean integrated lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) was determined to be 1.53 × 10−3 ± 1.71 × 10−4 within a range of 2.86 × 10−4 and 7.18 × 10−3. Mean child ILCR was about 70\% of adult ILCR and increased from 4.16 × 10−4 to 2.41 × 10−3 for sachet and 4.93 × 10−4 to 7.18 × 10−3 for bottled water. For adult ILCR, sachet water presented 2.86 × 10−4 to 1.65 × 10−3, and 3.38 × 10−4 to 4.93 × 10−3 for bottled water. This study confirmed the presence of phthalates and pathogenic bacteria in the samples, at-risk levels that require mitigation.},

	abstract = {Economic and spatial informality dominates the cityscape of countries in the Global South. From the perspective of urban practitioners and other stakeholders, there are two main schools of thought that discuss the roles of informality in the urban development discourse. The first school maintains that informality hinders the urban development process while the other posits that informality could be helpful in the urban sustainability push. In this article, the researchers, focusing on the latter, explores the productive functions of informality in developing sustainable Ghanaian cities. The researchers relied predominantly on secondary data. Using the Boolean search methodology, data were extracted from 85 articles/reports/websites that were obtained from online data and journal publishing repositories such as JSTOR, Scopus, SAGE and Taylor and Francis. The results from the thematic analysis of the data indicate that informality plays a vital role in promoting the economic, environmental, and social sustainability of cities in Ghana. Specifically, the informal economy and informal spaces contribute to the employment of both men and women, household income, tax revenue, waste management, water access, organic farming, health care access, social equity, and innovation. The paper concludes that informality in Ghana could profoundly facilitate the attainment of the sustainable city development objectives. Viewing informality through a productive lens, as we have argued in the paper, calls for a shift from ‘broad blanket and criminalisation’ policies on informality to more inclusive and pro-poor policies. Additionally, understanding the enormous opportunities informality presents to cities in the Global South will lead to increased investment and restructuring to mitigate the barriers its poses to the city development process.},

	abstract = {The roles of urban informalities in the advancement of the sustainable city agenda are contested in conventional literature. However, the contestation does not take account of the entire dimensions of sustainable cities. To present a holistic argument, the present study examines the roles of informalities in advancing the sustainable city agenda in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) by using the sustainable development prism as the analytical framework. A Boolean search methodology was adopted to obtain relevant literature written in the English language from repositories such as Scopus, JSTOR, and ProQuest. The results of a synthesis of the literature suggest that informalities play double-pronged roles in the pursuit of the sustainable city development agenda in SSA. Overall, the emergence of informality is as a result of the failure of the formal systems. They provide employment, secure household income and savings, support national income, provide household basic needs (water access and waste management), and enhance civic engagement. However, informalities contribute to social and gender inequality, insecurity, congestion, and pollution. Based on their positive roles in the advancement of sustainable cities, we recommend a rejection of the prohibitive policies and attitudes towards informalities and call for regularisation as an approach to address the associated ills.},

	abstract = {The African agricultural system is characterized by complex challenges such as famine, food insecurity, poor soil and quality standards, political instability, and inappropriate agricultural practices. The behavior over time graph revealed that as the African population increases, people explore new agricultural land that is in direct conflict with the conservation of forested areas, hence degrading the environment. These challenges in addition to the depletion of natural resources have worsened the plights of African farmers. The increasingly complex nature of the agricultural industry in Africa has necessitated an urgent need for the use of a systemic rather than a traditional approach in solving problems in agriculture. System archetypes were applied as diagnostic tools to anticipate potential problems and problem symptoms. Eleven system archetypes serve as the means for gaining insights into the underlying system structures from which the archetypal behaviors emerge. As part of a suite of tools, they are extremely valuable in developing broad understandings about agriculture and their environments and contribute to more effectively understanding the cause of a fix ?now? that gives rise to a much bigger problem to fix ?later?. The study revealed that opportunity and risk matrix as a policy tool does not solve the problems, but systemic approach would lead to the provision of the right management strategies. This approach facilitates adaptation and mitigation strategies towards the sustainable development for the agriculture in Africa. Copyright ? 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Public water companies in many countries in the global south struggle to meet the water needs of their growing urban populations, especially the urban poor. Consequently, the urban poor receive the worse form of water services mostly from unregulated water vendors and pay poverty penalty. Formalising the informal water vendors has only been mentioned in pro-poor water policies, but the reality only reveals policy rhetoric. This paper investigates the persistence of poverty penalty associated with water supply to the urban poor in Ghana from unregulated water vendors. The data used in the study were gathered through interviews with 78 water vendors (i.e. 53 fixed-point vendors and 25 mobile vendors) who were selected from two water-stressed poor urban communities and one poor urban settlement with water supply from the state utility provider. The results indicate that informal water vendors play a very important role in meeting the water needs of the urban poor. However, it was observed that the urban poor households paid a high-poverty premium for relying on these unregulated water vendors for their water needs. The paper concludes that a viable pro-poor water policy must strive to practically integrate the independent small-scale water providers in the urban water market in order to make an impact. Policy tools that can be used to integrate the private vendors into the urban water market and minimise the poverty penalty have been considered in the paper.},

These are based on economic, physical, commercial, environmental, and social subsystems and the reinforcing and balancing loops that influence key variables of interest in each are identified. The analysis identifies a series of shortcomings including a weak provider-customer relationship, limited governance capacity, inadequate coordination and integration between key players, shortfalls in physical supply and critical infrastructure, environmental degradation, and a lack of disaster response and recovery measures.A series of strategies are proposed as intervention actions that target the areas of potential leverage identified in the causal loop analysis, including improving customer-provider relationships; increasing coordination, collaboration, and integration; developing physical and informational infrastructure and enhancing environmental protection and rehabilitation. The impacts of these strategies are highlighted as strengthening key elements of the causal loop diagrams and addressing the resilience gaps identified. The systems mapping approach reveals that key issues are large-scale, cross-sectoral, and compounding. Remediation strategies must therefore also be multi-faceted and holistic in scope.},

In light of this, the paper addresses the question of why, given its higher level of per capita income and relatively strong growth, the housing conditions of the poor in Accra are considerably worse than those in a number of other African cities with lower incomes.There are not many data available to answer this question, so the method is indirect and takes two approaches. First, a variant of the monocentric city model is used to calculate Accra's housing supply elasticity relative to those of other similarly sized African cities. The model suggests that housing supply responsiveness is considerably lower in Accra, a result consistent with the observed higher housing costs. Secondly, a number of traditional housing demand and reduced-form equations are estimated for Accra and the other cities. This allows the formation of a quantitative judgment about Accra's housing supply elasticity. Taken together, the two approaches indicate that lower-income families in Accra have such poor housing conditions because the market is extremely unresponsive to demand. The welfare costs of current housing and land policies are considerable. The results suggest that making Accra's real estate market more responsive would go a long way towards improving the effectiveness of the broader policy environment. It would also no doubt improve the housing conditions of the poor and help to reduce the city's expanding footprint.]},

Here we discuss the burden for households of coping with, and adapting to, adverse water conditions in economically marginal areas of Mexico City. We argue that households’ efforts to adapt in conditions of marginality can come at the expense of households’ investment in other aspects of human welfare, reinforcing poverty traps. Both economic theory and social-ecological systems analysis point to the importance of cross-scalar investments and institutional support in breaking down persistent poverty traps. Using data from twelve focus groups conducted in Mexico City, we illustrate how such cross-scale connectivity is failing as a result of lack of trust and transparency, the difficulty of collective action, and the devolution of some responsibilities for risk management from the public sector to the household level. We conclude our analysis by arguing for greater attention to these tradeoffs in public policy to help ensure that adaptation does not come at the cost of more generic welfare gains among the most vulnerable populations.},

Therefore, since 1990, many countries, including Ghana, have introduced various changes in their water sector to encourage good governance in the management of the resource. Using interviews and a review of policy and regulatory documents, this study examines recent changes in the water sector in Ghana to identify challenges for good governance in water resources management. The results suggest that the introduction of a new institutional framework and several regulatory mechanisms, including policies, rules, regulations, and laws, has decentralized water management system, increased stakeholder participation, granted voice to marginalized stakeholders, and brought government and communities together in the decision-making process. However, the results further reveal that several challenges, including institutional barriers, exclusion or underrepresentation of key stakeholders, corruption, multisectoral conflict, collaboration preferences, and others continue to frustrate good governance in water resources management. Deliberately committing to the principles of good governance, amending ineffective regulatory mechanisms, and adequately resourcing regulatory institutions can help avoid many of the challenges in the water sector and propel the country toward sustainable water resources management.},

Drawing on the largest data set assembled on rural water points in sub-Saharan Africa to date, this paper employs logistic regression analyses to identify operational, technical, institutional, financial, and environmental predictors of functionality for over 25 000 community-managed handpumps in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda. Risk factors significantly associated with nonfunctionality across all three countries were (a) system age, (b) distance from district/county capital, and (c) absence of user fee collection. In at least one of the three countries, other variables found to have significant multivariable adjusted associations with functionality status included well type, handpump type, funding organization, implementing organization, spare parts proximity, availability of a handpump mechanic, regular servicing, regular water committee meetings, women in key water committee positions, rainfall season, and perceived water quality. While the findings reinforce views that a multifaceted range of conditions is critical for the sustainability of community-managed handpumps, they also demonstrate that these factors remain absent from a high proportion of cases. Governments and development partners must significantly strengthen postconstruction support for operation and maintenance systems, and greater efforts are needed to test and evaluate alternative models for managing handpump water supplies.},

Financial sustainability questions the business models behind these water technologies. This article makes three contributions to business models in the context of fluoride and arsenic mitigation. Firstly, we describe four business models: A) low-value devices given away to people living in extreme poverty, B) high-value devices sold to low-income customers, C) communities as beneficiaries of micro-water treatment plants and D) entrepreneurs as franchisees for selling water services and highlight the emergence of hybrid business models. Secondly, we show current business model innovations such as cost transparency \& cost reductions, secured \& extended water payments, business diversification and distribution channels. Thirdly, we describe skills and competencies as part of capacity building for creating even more business model innovations. Together, these three contributions will create more awareness of the role of business models in scaling-up water treatment technologies.},

	abstract = {In the wake of climate change and flood severity in Ghana, the government of Ghana has developed a ten year adaptation strategy document (National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy) to assist institutions and stakeholders in addressing the impact of climate change in various sectors of the country. Institutional role has become necessary in tackling flood simply because the success of any adaptation strategies in part depend on the institutional arrangement in place and studies have been conducted to affirm this argument (Agrawal, McSweeney \&amp; Perrin, 2008; IPCC 2013). This thesis focuses on an analysis of the document and how it addresses flooding in the wake of climate change. Flooding forms a major disaster that the country as a whole faces annually but focus is on the Greater Accra region specifically the Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA). The study documents the strengths and weaknesses of the document as a national adaptation document. It establishes that though the document exists, it is not available to the institutions and the assembly members for implementation of the strategies. Further, in relation to local institutions, the research finds that assembly members are more committed to addressing flood problems and taking the initiatives to undertake minor projects in their communities to minimize the effects of flooding. These minor projects such as de-siltation and clean ups are in themselves adaptation strategies (Linham \&amp; Nicholls 2010). The study also finds that lack of communication among institutions, limited resources, lack of institutional leadership and social connection in accessing resources were barriers to successful planning and implementation of adaptation strategies.},

	abstract = {In a rapidly changing water resources system, dynamic models based on the notion of systems thinking can serve as useful analytical tools for scientists and policy-makers to study changes in key system variables over time. In this paper, an integrated system dynamics simulation model was developed using a system dynamics modelling approach to examine the feedback processes and interaction between the population, the water resource, and the agricultural production sub-sectors of the Volta River Basin in West Africa. The objective of the model is to provide a learning tool for policy-makers to improve their understanding of the long-term dynamic behaviour of the basin, and as a decision support tool for exploring plausible policy scenarios necessary for sustainable water resource management and agricultural development. Structural and behavioural pattern tests, and statistical test were used to evaluate and validate the performance of the model. The results showed that the simulated outputs agreed well with the observed reality of the system. A sensitivity analysis also indicated that the model is reliable and robust to uncertainties in the major parameters. Results of the business as usual scenario showed that total population, agricultural, domestic, and industrial water demands will continue to increase over the simulated period. Besides business as usual, three additional policy scenarios were simulated to assess their impact on water demands, crop yield, and net-farm income. These were the development of the water infrastructure (scenario 1), cropland expansion (scenario 2) and dry conditions (scenario 3). The results showed that scenario 1 would provide the maximum benefit to people living in the basin. Overall, the model results could help inform planning and investment decisions within the basin to enhance food security, livelihoods development, socio-economic growth, and sustainable management of natural resources.},

Plagued by arsenic contamination, the state has been pushing to expand and consolidate a networked piped infrastructure bringing in treated surface water. This shift threatens to reconfigure the existing diverse infrastructure configurations that are fragmented, incremental in nature. We examine the scholarship on the situated and embodied forms of Urban Political Ecology to understand how everyday social relations and plural practices at the level of the town, the ?para? (roughly neighbourhood), and the household shape socio-material artefacts. The shift in the socio-technical configurations, in turn, lead to new forms of power coalitions, network conflicts, and collaborations. Through an in-depth qualitative examination, we conclude that heterogeneous infrastructure configurations and everyday practices are not only gendered but also intricately embedded within intersections of social affinity, intimate geographies, and embodied class power relations in the ?para?.},

	abstract = {[Thousands of water points have been installed across sub-Saharan Africa over the past four decades; however, a number have been found to be dry/low-yielding, unsafe for human consumption, and in some cases marked with appearance, taste, and odour problems. Subsequently, many users have been unable or unwilling to use these water points and have had to revert to the use of unimproved water sources. A number of factors could be causing each of these problems, either directly or indirectly. Furthermore, these factors may be interdependent and these relationships may be marked by non-linearities, feedbacks, and time delays. Deciphering which factors need to be prioritized becomes a confusing and complex task. To help understand the impact of different interventions, this paper proposes the adoption of systems-based analysis for looking at water point failure and introduces some of the more common qualitative and quantitative analytical tools that could be used to reveal how these complexities might be managed more effectively. While the use of these tools within the WASH sector has been limited to date, they hold potential for helping to identify the most suitable remedies for water point failure. Examples of where such tools have been used in relation to water point failure are reviewed, and the extent to which each approach could be applied is examined from a practitioner perspective, recognizing the limitations arising from the differing data needs and time-consuming nature of each type of analysis.]},

Furthermore the cost-effectiveness in reducing the disease burden through targeted interventions was evaluated. Five risk pathways for drinking water were identified through a survey (110 families), namely household storage, private yard taps, communal taps, communal wells and water sachets. Samples from each source were analyzed for Escherichia coli and Ascaris contamination. Published ratios between E. coli and other pathogens were used for the QMRA and disease burden calculations. The major part of the burden of disease originated from E. coli O157:H7 (78\%) and the least important contributor was Cryptosporidium (0.01\%). Other pathogens contributed 16\% (Campylobacter), 5\% (Rotavirus) and 0.3\% (Ascaris). The sum of the disease burden of these pathogens was 0.5DALYs per person per year, which is much higher than the WHO reference level. The major contamination pathway was found to be household storage. Disinfection of water at household level was the most cost-effective intervention ({\textless}5USD/DALY-averted) together with hygiene education. Water supply network improvements were significantly less cost-effective.},

The objective of this study was to determine the microbiological quality of different types of packaged drinking water available in Accra, Ghana. Sixty samples of sachet water and ten of (PET) bottled water were randomly purchased from various locations in Accra. Bacteriological and parasitological analyses of the packaged (sachet and bottled) and tap water (as control) were done according to standard procedures. Fifty-two out of 60 sachet water samples (86.7\%) had HPC levels well above the internationally recommended limits. For the bottled water, nine out of the ten (90\%) were within the recommended limits for HPC. Two out of the five (40\%) tap water samples (control samples) had HPC above the recommended limits of 500 cfu/mL. While none of the bottled water samples showed the presence of protozoa, two out of the five tap water and 31 out of the 60 sachet water samples had a wide range of protozoa including rotifers.

	abstract = {Urbanization is a product of development and in recent years, most cities have been experiencing unprecedented growth with improvements in their infrastructure. The obvious benefits of the process tend to paradoxically overshadow its insidious symptoms, as unregulated growth tend to create huge unmet needs such as lack of access to good-quality services, increasing poverty and deteriorating environment. The origin of this dichotomy is rooted in the governance practices where city authorities pay greater attention to issues of managing the ‘global commons’ than the critical ‘brown issues’, such as improving water supply and sanitation that affect the urban poor. Using multiple research techniques, this study highlights how such neglected necessities consign sections of the population to one of the deadly infectious diseases Ghana has ever known—cholera. The paper calls for an all-inclusive and explicitly pro-poor community-led orientation as one of the effective strategy for achieving equity in the urban settings and possibly, helps win the ‘war’ on poor sanitation.},

It is the principal outlet through which all major drainage channels in the city empty their wastes into the sea. Large amounts of untreated industrial waste emptied into surface drains has led to severe pollution in the lagoon and disrupted its natural ecology. The increased levels of industrial activity and consumption by the urban population lead to the generation of copious quantities of waste. Managing the volume of wastes poses a major challenge for the city authorities, particularly, ensuring that all the waste generated is collected for disposal. In Accra, the Waste Management Department is currently capable of collecting only 60 percent of the waste generated daily. The rest is dumped in open spaces, in surface drains, and into water bodies which end up in the Korle Lagoon. High eutrophication levels have developed in the shallow water body. The net effect is that, at the slightest downpour, the lagoon overflows its banks causing regular flooding in parts of the city.},

	abstract = {A dominant narrative in conventional literature is that informality is a barrier against sustainable city development. However, in recent times, some scholars argue that informal urbanism has positive implications for the attainment of the sustainable city development goals. Following this view, this study investigates the experimental projects (referred to as Experimental Informal Urbanism – EIU) developed by slum dwellers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in response to their deprivations and discusses their implications for the region's sustainable city development agenda. The study relied solely on secondary data (both scholarly and grey literature) that were extracted using search engines and data repositories such as Scopus, Web of Science, Google, Google Scholar, and the Mendeley Literature search function. The results indicate that slum residents in major cities in SSA have engineered innovative solutions to their deprivations. Some of the initiatives are: a) greenspace development on refuse dumpsites, b) solar-powered cars, c) productive reuse of plastic waste, organic waste, and electronic waste (e-waste), d) water sharing and e) plastic and sandbag housing. These innovative initiatives promote resilience and have positive implications for the sustainable city development agenda of SSA cities. However, some of these initiatives could have adverse health and environmental consequences. We therefore call on states and city authorities to consciously take stock of innovative initiatives of slums and research ways to harness, replicate, and integrate them into their sustainable city development agenda.},

Governments have more recently employed equity principles into their policies and frameworks to improve resiliency of such communities to disasters. However, although many city agencies have an overlying goal to advance racial equity, the reality of coordination efforts may reveal shortcomings that perpetuate inequitable outcomes in the decision-making process of city stakeholders. This study assessed internal stakeholder interviews from city agencies, social services, and a nonprofit in summer of 2018 to identify obstacles and opportunities for building community resilience in Southeast Austin. An inductive qualitative analysis was then performed to extract emergent themes from the interviews. Key recommendations for improving equitable community resilience planning were developed such as, increased internal coordination and collaboration, and improved external communication and engagement. This study contributes to understanding the relationship of equity in community resiliency planning and represents an important contribution to understanding the influential factors that shape a decision-makers role in planning efforts. Improving such understandings can support more collaborative and participatory decision-making processes between affected community members and city agencies.},

There are, however, few studies of packaged water production. This study aims to assess the source water, treatment, and manufacturing characteristics of sachet water (vended in 500 mL plastic bags), together with point-of-manufacture risks to hygienic production. A sample of 90 sachets was collected of brands sold in four neighbourhoods in Accra, Ghana, their packaging and physical characteristics recorded, and a risk score calculated from these. Production processes were observed at 60 associated sachet factories, producers interviewed, and surrounding neighbourhoods surveyed for contamination hazards. 80\% of producers packaged groundwater from boreholes and all treated water via reverse osmosis. Almost all manufacturers (95\%) reported site visits by regulators in the previous year and few risks to hygienic production were observed at factories. Sanitary risk scores were 9.2\% higher at the seven factories never visited by a regulator, though this difference was not significant (t = 1.81; p = 0.07). This survey suggests most Ghanaian sachet water originates from groundwater and is comparatively safe, though a minority remains unregulated. Groundwater governance policy could support this industry in meeting Greater Accra's growing water demand through the designation of protected municipal wellfields.},

Several new metrics of household water insecurity have been proposed and validated, but few have been field-tested for reliability in diverse contexts. We used confirmatory factor analysis to test the psychometric equivalence of one such metric—the Household Water Insecurity Experiences (HWISE) scale—across two survey waves administered 18 months apart in similar climatic conditions among households in a peri-urban community outside of Accra, Ghana. The HWISE metric was not equivalent across survey waves, which may be attributable to the metric itself, sample size, subtle instrumentation changes, or other unobserved factors. Test-retest reliability may also be difficult to achieve given the dynamic nature of household water use, and we discuss the implications of using household water insecurity metrics as longitudinal measures of well-being in global anti-poverty programs.},

	abstract = {The aim of providing affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all requires an in-depth understanding of the issues that affect energy access and energy fuel choice, particularly as related to urban informal settlements or slums. Within unequal societies, such as South Africa, a reliance on technical solutions to address access and inequality is inadequate, leading to resistance and protest. Further, introduction of a technical solution – such as solar PV - to address energy access in urban informal settlements, is a complex process, and requires a systems thinking perspective. Using Community Based System Dynamics modelling, this paper therefore investigated the issues that affect energy fuel choice and energy access as related to the introduction of a renewable energy solution in Enkanini informal settlement. Different energy user groups were engaged in the identification of the factors that affect energy access and energy fuel choice; the relationships between these factors in order to improve future interventions; and development of causal loop diagrams to visualise the key feedback loops. The identified factors were economic and market related such as affordability, availability, and land ownership but also included a range of socio-political aspects. 17 feedback loops emerged, of which 13 were reinforcing loops, and 4 were balancing loops. The key feedback loops relate to community empowerment and representation, whilst participation in the political process and the quest for legitimacy through direct electricity connections were recognised as broader issues to be addressed.},
